# Custom Piper TTS Voices

Piper TTS is an AI-based generative audio model for text-to-speech synthesis. It can be trained on any voice to produce realistic, natural-sounding speech. This repository contains all the custom voices Iâ€™ve created for Piper TTS, available for anyone to use.
You can find the original Piper TTS project here:

## Voices
Each voice in this repository includes the model files and configuration necessary to use it with Piper. Feel free to explore, download, and use any of them in your own TTS projects.
